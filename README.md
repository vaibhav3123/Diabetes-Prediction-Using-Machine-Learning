# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether an individual is diabetic based on medical features using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Pregnancies**
- **Glucose**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Skin Thickness**
- **Insulin**
- **BMI**
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**
- **Age**
- **Outcome** (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data loading and preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** – for scaling, model building, and evaluation

## ⚙️ Process Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Imported dataset using Pandas.
   - Performed basic data inspection and cleaning.

2. **Feature Scaling**
   - Used `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn to normalize the data.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using:
     - Accuracy Score
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Classification Report
