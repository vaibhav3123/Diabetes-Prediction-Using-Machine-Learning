# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
A machine learning project that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical parameters such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, and age. This project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation techniques to assist in early detection of diabetes.
